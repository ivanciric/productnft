Store owners can now offer products as unique NFT variants, weather product image or AI generated art, on the NEAR protocol via Mintbase.

ProductNFT is an innovative WooCommerce plugin designed to seamlessly bridge the gap between traditional e-commerce and the burgeoning world of NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). By enabling merchants to offer their products as unique NFT variants, ProductNFT ushers in a new era of digital asset ownership and collectibility, all powered by the efficiency and scalability of the NEAR protocol.
